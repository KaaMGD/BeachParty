# Beach Party
big nsfw mod for a nsfw game monster girl dreams

**Requires game version v25.2a or newer.**

## Installation

Copy the url to the `Source code (zip)` in the latest [release](https://github.com/KaaMGD/BeachParty/releases) and use the in-game Mod manager in the main menu to download.

## Manual Mod Installation

After extracting, directly place the folder titled `Beach` into the game's `Mods` folder.

If you get missing file errors when entering the world map, make sure your installation has a correct folder structure. The file path should be verified to match the patch seen in the errors:

`\Mods\Beach\Images\MGD_Map_Icon_Beach`

As opposed to:

`\Mods\BeachParty-<versionNumber>\Beach\Images\MGD_Map_Icon_Beach`
